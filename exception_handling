An exception is thrown when an unexpected error is encountered. Exceptions are objects. 
All exception types-- that is, any class designed for throwable objects -- must extend the 
class Throwable or one of its subclasses. The Throwable class contains a string that can be used to describe the exception .
By convention, new exception types extend Exception, a subclass of Throwable.

Checked and Unchecked exception:
CHECKED: are the exceptions that are checked at compile time
